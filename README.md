#grdd.css
A lightweight [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) grid built using [BEMIT](http://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/) (by [Harry Roberts](https://twitter.com/csswizardry)), [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) and a lot of love ‚ù§

##Disclaimer

I built this grid *just for fun*, I know there are many others (maybe too many) better than *grdd*.
I really wanted to use [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss) but I thought that [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) would provide a better environment.

##Specs

* *grdd* weights **1.810 bytes** with one breakpoint
* *grdd* **uses inline-block** just because is fully supported from any browser
* *grdd* has **6 columns**
* *grdd* **uses fractions**: `.grdd__item--1/2`
* *grdd* uses **@ for breakpoints**: `.grdd__item--1/1@sm`
* *grdd* is **infinitely nestable**
* *grdd* **respects BEM** naming convention
* *grdd* **respects OOCSS** philosophy
* *grdd* is written in only **60 lines of SASS**, including *comments* and *extra spaces*

##Features

You can customize *grdd* changing the variables in the top lines and recompiling it.
*grdd* uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), so the only thing you have to do in order to recompile it is:
```
$ cd grdd.css/
$ npm i
$ gulp compile
```

### Namespaces
*grdd* is a component, so, following the conventions of *BEMIT* we should append a `.c-` to the selector, however, you can change that prefix or even delete it.
```SASS
$grdd-namespace: "whatever-"; // Whatever namespace
$grdd-namespace: "";          // No namespace
```

### Gutter
The default gutter between columns is `.625em`.
```SASS
$grdd-gutter: 0; // No gutter
```

### Sizes
Probably you don't want the default sizes (`.grdd__item--1/2, ...`) because you already have a list of sizes in your own project. Turning `$grdd-sizes` to `false` allows you to have only the *grdd* component without all the fractions, saving a lot of space.
```SASS
$grdd-sizes: false; // No fractions
```

### Breakpoints
You can easily add and remove breakpoints but remember that the more breakpoints you add, the more *grdd* will weight.
```SASS
$grdd-breakpoints: ( 
  "sm": 48em,
  "lg": 75em
);
```

## Usage
*grdd* is simple to use!
```HTML
<div class="c-grdd">
  <div class="c-grdd__item c-grdd__item--1/2 c-grdd__item--1/1@sm"></div><!--
  --><div class="c-grdd__item c-grdd__item--1/2 c-grdd__item--1/1@sm"></div>
</div>
```
This grid has two 50% columns by default, and two 100% columns when the viewport will be < 48em.
Remember to add a comment from the end of each *grid__item* to the start of the next one, this because *grdd* uses [inline-block](https://css-tricks.com/fighting-the-space-between-inline-block-elements/).
